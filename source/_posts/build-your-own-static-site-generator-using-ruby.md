Zammu now has the ability to support any Ruby based static site generator. You
can now select the 'Bundle and Ruby' in the first step, and fill out the build
command and the output directory in the second step to configure it.

In the following example I am using nanoc to build my websites.

{% asset_img bundle-and-ruby-1.png Step 1, Select the Bundle and Ruby option %}
{% asset_img bundle-and-ruby2.png Step 2, Fill out the build command and output directory %}


Happy building :)

P.S: I built a small TIL builder to collaborate on TILs among small teams, check
it out here: http://til.zammu.in/ The source for this repository is at: https://github.com/minhajuddin/til
