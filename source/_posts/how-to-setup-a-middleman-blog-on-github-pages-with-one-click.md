## Quick start
Go here and follow the UI: https://zammu.in/themes/danielbayerlein:middleman-casper?invitation_code=THEME

We have been trying to find ways to make using Middleman as frictionless as possible.
We'd love to hear the feedback from the community if there are other things we can improve.
We plan on adding more such themes using other static site generators which should make static site generators
more approachable.

Here is a video of me setting up my Resume using [another theme avaiable on Zammu](https://zammu.in/themes/reefab:resumeman).
