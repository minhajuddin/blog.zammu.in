[Our brand new documentation site](http://docs.zammu.in/) is up.

We believe in [Dogfooding](http://blog.codinghorror.com/the-ultimate-dogfooding-story/) and have built this documentation
site using the awesome [MkDocs](http://www.mkdocs.org) static site generator. It
is really neat, and doesn't have a lot of configuration required. You too can
contribute to our project by creating pull requests on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/zammu/docs.zammu.in/).

By the way, we have added support for Python and Pip based projects too (MkDocs
is a python app).
