We have just added a feature which allows you to trigger deploys every hour or
every day. This makes it super easy to have a queue of posts in Jekyll or other
static site generators.

All you need to do to enable this is go to your site's edit page and change the
**Recurring deploy schedule** and change it to 'Every Hour' or 'Every Day'
