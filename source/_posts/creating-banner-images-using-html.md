While building [Zammu](https://zammu.in/), I had to build some banner images to use for the [Facebook](https://facebook.com/zammuhq) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/zammuhq) cover photos. I am not very good with image editors like [Gimp](https://www.gimp.org/). However, I know my way around HTML. These days, you can create any kind of layout with HTML. I just create the HTML needed for my banner image using the awesome [bootstrap framework](http://getbootstrap.com). Opened it in Firefox and used the Firefox's new ["Screenshot Node"](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2015/09/trainspotting-firefox-41/) feature to grab a snapshot of the image.

Here is a screenshot of me capturing a screenshot :)

And here is my banner image :)
